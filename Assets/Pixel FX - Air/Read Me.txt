FX DETAILS

Buff

- Animations: 2
- Frames: 24
- Loop: No
- Details
	- This buff will imbue your armor with nature attribute which may render you immune to earth, nature skills. Up to you.
	
	- An ancestral figure has been summoned and has cast a buff on you.
	- Maybe you get invincibility for a set amount of seconds? Maybe extra damage?
	- You can always choose to give you defense against holy or dark attacks or maybe even heal you. Your call.
	- Remember to put the lady behind the player and the cross in front of the player!


Air I

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 12
- Loop: Yes
- Details
	- The most basic air attack that you can conjure. This one only hits the closest enemy though!
	

Air II

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 14
- Loop: Yes
- Details:
	- Use this skill if you want to hit multiple enemies at once.
	- This skill is semi slow but when it reaches the enemies but once it does great damage.


Air III

- Animations: 2
- Frames: 39
- Loop: Yes
- Details: 
	- Make this skill in a way that it hits all the enemies in a certain range.
	- The best thing about this skill is that it hits the enemy multiple times.
	- There is a single animation and also a looped animation if you want the skill to stay in a spot for a long time.
	- If the enemies walk to the skill then they will get damaged.


Daze

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 11
- Loop: Yes
- Details: 
	- This skill is meant to only hit one enemy (the end of the animation).
	- If the enemy survives it can cause the enemy to be stunned.
	- If anything you can make it damage all the enemies in its way and deals more damage to the last enemy.


Breath

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 21
- Loop: No
- Details: 
	- This skill to defeat one enemy.
	- You can each orb deal damage everytime it touches an enemy.
	- Maybe, it can be used as a high damage per second attack.
	- Best used for bosses in my opinion.


Tornado

- Animations: 1
- Frames: 17
- Loop: Yes
- Details: 
	- This one has a idle animation for when it stays in one position and also a looped animation for when it moves.
	- You can make it hit all the enemies in its way
	- You can make it return by flipping the animation dealing double damage.


Fly

- Animations: 7
- Frames: 43
- Loop: Yes
- Details:
	- This animation has 2 layers. 
	- There are wings that go in the front of the character and wings that go behind the character.
	- The animations included are:
			1. Start
			2. Spread Wings
			3. Shield
			4. Take Off
			5. Fly Loop
			6. Landing
			7. End
	- Spread Wings and Shield are optional
	- If you want to use shield the wings will go in front of the character
	- Every other animation will have the wings behind the character.
	- The best way I can think of on using this is by putting the character between the wings
			1. When you use the skill the wings will grow (Start)
			2. The character will be ready for lift off (Take Off) which will proceed to the flying loop animation.
			3. Here you can make your character ignore gravity and make it move up/down/side to side with ease.
	- Lastly, when skill duration (if you have one) reaches its limit the character you have to switch 
			1. To the Landing scene until it touches the floor 
			2. Then switch to the final animation (End) where the wings disappear.
